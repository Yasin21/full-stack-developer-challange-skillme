## MySkillME Fullstack Developer Challange

### Catalog Description 
Your company wishes to record the click action of the user to see which content would attract more attention. For that purpose, as a full stack developer, you are asked to build a click recorder with a backend to record user’s click action.

Your app should record the location, time and whether the user is left or right-clicking the page. While no content is required to be displayed, the data should be sent to the backend and stored in any database you want.

Ideally, a graph for visualizing the data you recorded should be provided on the admin panel to help your peers analyse user behaviour.

You should focus on the Core and Main goals first. After all of those are finished, you can start to complete as many Advanced/Hard goals as you can.

Please try to achieve as many goals as you can within 48 hours. It is not required to complete all of them.

Please check the recommended coding languages on the right.
